"""``normalize_egomotion`` must scale the right columns without touching its input.

The failure this guards against is silent. Scaling in place mutates the caller's
batch, and the scaling is not idempotent — a second forward over the same batch
divides speed by 33 again. Nothing raises; the run produces a plausible number
from an input that is two orders of magnitude too small. The multi-seed loop in
``Platform/pipelines/overlay_precompute.py`` reuses one batch across seeds and
hits exactly this.
